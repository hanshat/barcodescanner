<h1 align="center">Barcode/QR code Scanner</h1>

A Progressive Web Application (PWA) that scans barcodes of various formats, using the [Barcode Detection API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Barcode_Detection_API).

> **NOTE**: The Barcode Detection API is part of the [Fugu](https://fugu-tracker.web.app/) project. Currently it is supported only on Chromium browsers in MacOS and Android. For non-supporting browsers, a [polyfill](https://github.com/gruhn/barcode-detector) is used.
